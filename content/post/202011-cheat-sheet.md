Here are my current recommendations. (I have not yet fully researched this
election. As of October 1st, I've researched and written up all the California
and Berkeley propositions; I haven't written up most candidates yet and I'm not
even sure if I have a complete list of county-level propositions, let alone
opinions.)

For more details, read my full posts on [propositions]({{< relref
"202011-props.md" >}}) and on [candidates]({{< relref "202011-candidates.md"
>}}).
