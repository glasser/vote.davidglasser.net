We all go into the ballot booth with our own background and biases. This is my
general political worldview. If this doesn't sound much like you, you probably
don't need to read this site at all.

I don't believe that voting and organization around the electoral mechanism is
the only or the best way to achieve positive change in our society or our
government. But I do believe it is one way and one worth taking seriously.  I do
my best to research every candidate and question on my ballot for every
election, and come to a well-informed position. I am sharing my opinions on this
site because friends have noticed that I care a lot and often ask for my
opinions. I don't think my opinions are always the most well-informed or
correct, but given that I have them, I might as well share them. (I have done
this for years on private locations like LiveJournal and Facebook. Starting November
2016, I'm experimenting with doing it more publicly.) I try to ensure that "have
strong opinions about my ballot" is not my only contribution to making our
society a better place, but do not always live up to that standard.

I'm a thirty-something cis white Jewish man living in Berkeley, California. I'm
the father of two kids who I intend to send to our local public schools. I
formerly rented in the Mission and SOMA in San Francisco. I work at a VC-funded
startup in San Francisco; before 2012 I worked at a larger tech company and rode
the buses down the peninsula. My wife and I own our home. Pre-covid, I commuted
daily via BART and relied primarily on walking, BART, biking, AC Transit, and
Muni to get around. (These days I work from home, don't go to too many places,
walk and bike, and look forward to returning to public transit.) We do now own a
minivan but do not use it for any regular work or preschool commutes (when they
existed).

I hope for candidates to match to match my personal beliefs more and more
closely as their district shrinks.  So I often find myself excited about
presidential candidates who are farther from my beliefs than local candidates
who I'd never vote for.

I generally think that government has a role in creating a more equal and fair
society, and that one powerful mechanism of achieving that goal is via
progressive taxation and the creation of social safety nets.  On the whole I
tend to vote in favor of most taxes and bonds, especially renewing existing
expiring taxes.  I believe that the restrictions written into the California
constitution by anti-tax forces in 1978's Proposition 13 and related measures
have had a corrosive force on the state, and wish they did not force so much of
Californian financial decision-making into the ballot box.

In general I believe we are forced to do too much governing via propositions. If
a proposition is put on the ballot by the legislature or city council via a
non-contentious vote (ie, the vast majority of non-Republicans voted for it) and
is only on the ballot because some other proposition forced it to be, my default
is to vote yes unless I have strong objections.

I endeavor to support equality and justice for people of all races, religions,
genders and gender identities, sexual orientations, classes, etc. I do my best
to be a good ally, though that is an ongoing process, not a status I can claim.

I am a strong supporter of abortion rights, marriage equality, trans rights, and
gun control.

I support the rights of undocumented immigrants, such as my great-grandmother
after whom we named my daughter.

I am fully aware that I am a white person who recently moved into a historically
black neighborhood (though my wife has lived in the neighborhood off and on for
decades) and that makes me part of the problem of gentrification. I do my best
to counteract that effect via respect for my neighbors and via the ballot box,
but acknowledge that this may not be fully possible.

I believe that a huge amount of what law enforcement agencies do is actively
harmful to my values and to real safety, and that goverments must stop defunding
education, health, housing and so many other important priorities, and start
defunding the police.

The housing crisis is the one of the biggest challenges facing the Bay Area
right now. I don't believe I have all the answers to this problem, but I believe
that one root cause is the lack of housing construction (market-rate and
affordable/subsidized) over decades, and that any solution needs to include
building new housing (of all kinds). I sympathize with those who see dense urban
construction as the harbinger of displacement, but it does not seem that
preventing development has done an effective job of preventing displacement. I
trust neither developers nor NIMBYs, and it's frustrating that it seems like
most local politicians fall too far to one side or the other.

Specifically, I believe that the market-rate housing crisis and
affordable/subsidized housing crises are both real and are intertwined, but
require different solutions.  I believe focused development of market-rate
housing, especially dense transit-friendly housing, is likely to help the
market-rate housing crisis, which admittedly is the one that affects my friends
the most. (That development should still have strong controls preventing direct
displacement.) But I don't believe market-rate housing development will do much
to support those who can't afford market-rate housing, and if done carelessly
will make matters worse for them. Solving that requires investment in
specifically building affordable housing.  Unfortunately, it feels like most
local politicians are only interested in solving one of these twin problems.  At
this point, I am mostly skeptical of anyone who believes that they have found
the single truth on how to fix the housing crisis.

In general, I find that when [East Bay for
Everyone](https://eastbayforeveryone.org/) (the East Bay YIMBY group) and the
[East Bay DSA](https://www.eastbaydsa.org/) agree on a housing-related issue, I
agree with them. And on issues where they disagree (as is more common), I am
internally split.

While I can find plenty to criticize about the Democratic Party (like any
organization of its size and diversity), I believe on the whole it is the
organization most devoted to electorally accomplishing the sort of change I want
to see in our country's government.  While I do consider candidates on their own
merits, I have historically nearly always ended up voting for Democrats in
contested races.  (I would have voted for Nader in 2000 had I been a year older;
I also would have regretted that vote within weeks.) I'd like to see a system
with more competitive parties and I do evaluate third-party and independent
candidates for local positions. That said, I don't find presidential candidates
from parties who do not have the organization, dedication, or representation to
get even a handful of state legislators elected to be worth considering.  I have
been fortunate to live in municipalities since 2002 which use instant-runoff
voting for local elections and hope to see more of it in the future.

On the other hand, anyone who is still a member of the Republican Party in this era
has chosen to prove themelves unworthy of my consideration.

I generally indicate how strongly I feel about my position on an issue by
WHETHER OR NOT I CAPITALIZE MY OPINION.

If I change my mind about an issue before the election, I will update the
relevant post in place, and may not explicitly mention that I did so. However,
