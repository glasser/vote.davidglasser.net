This is a relatively short post. The most controversial election on my ballot is the Presidential primary, and I'm pretty sure most of my friends have plenty of information about that already. All five propositions are "give money to kids?" and seem like easy yeses. There are only a few other contested positions, and most of them are incumbents vs relatively unknown challengers.

County committee and judge seem to be the most interesting offices on this ballot. I haven't had time to research them in full yet (I received my voter guide after early voting started!) or write up my full thoughts, but friends have already been asking my opinions, so here's my current thoughts. I hope to flesh this out further next week.

Here are my current recommendations in ballot order.

what|my vote
--:|:-----
President | Bernie Sanders (or maybe Elizabeth Warren)
County Committee, D15 | Alfred Twu, Paola Laverde, Nick Pilch, others?
US Representative, D13 | BARBARA LEE
State Senate, D9 | NANCY SKINNER
State Assembly, D15 | Sara Brink??? (primary-specific decision)
Superior Court Judge, Office 2 | Elena Condes???
Alameda County Supervisor, D5 | Nick Pilch???
13 (school construction bonds) | Yes
Alameda County C (sales tax for kids healthcare and preschool) | **YES!**
Berkeley E (teacher property tax) | **YES!**
Berkeley G (school construction bonds) | **YES!**
Berkeley H (school maintenance property tax) | **YES!**

A quick note on how these elections work.

Statewide elections use the "top two primary": of the three candidates for Assembly, two will definitely end up on the ballot in November. In practice, this means that the Assembly race is a race between Brink (independent) and Solnordal (Republican) to see who will challenge Wicks (Democratic incumebent) in November. (This also applies to the US Representative and State Senate races, but neither race has more than 2 candidates, so barring a miracle of write-in votes, we know exactly what those races will look like in November.)

On the other hand, the local County Supervisor and Judge races are "non-partisan elections". On the surface, they look similar: candidates are listed without parties, and no more than two will make it to the November ballot. However, if any candidate gets 50% of the vote, they win outright without a November election at all. So (barring a tie or write-in shenanigans) this is the only election we will have for the County Supervisor seat, and the Judge election may or may not continue to November.

The County Committee race (where 8 will win) takes place entirely on this ballot. Note that you must be a registered Democrat to vote in this race; being an independent voter who requests a Democratic Presidential ballot is not enough.


## President: Bernie Sanders (or  maybe Elizabeth Warren)

My friends really do ask for my opinions on elections (that's why I make this
site!) but that's generally for the nitty-gritty local stuff, not the most
prominent election in years. So I'm not going to spend too many words on this one.

I think Sanders and Warren would both make excellent presidents. If I could vote
for both in some sort of ranked-choice system, I would. Right now I am leaning
towards Sanders. My wife is planning to vote for Warren, and I feel pretty good
about our household combined voting for both of them.

I do not think any of the other remaining candidates would be good presidents. I
especially find the entire Bloomberg candidacy disgusting, and would find it
challenging to muster any enthusiasm in November towards doing anything other
than checking the box on my own ballot for him.

In the unlikely event that I find more time for this site this week, I'll expand
more on why I am leaning towards Sanders over Warren.


## Democratic Party County Committee, Assembly District 15: Alfred Twu, Paola Laverde, Nick Pilch, others?

What exactly is the County Committee? This diagram sheds a bit of light on it:

A large amount of what this committee does is make endorsements in future
elections that get to count as the official Democratic Party endorsement. These
hold a lot of weight for many voters! So it's good to vote for people who have
similar opinions as yourself.

Note that you must be a registered Democrat to vote in this race (which is for a
party position, not a government position): independents voting in the
Democratic Presidential primary do not get this on their ballot.

I've been very impressed with Alfred Twu, who I first learned about as a candidate for City Council two years ago.  Twu is an outspoken member of the YIMBY org East Bay for Everyone and the DSA, which is basically my political sweet spot. I also really enjoy Twu's [urban art](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~atwu/alfred/index.html) and graphic design, including the diagram above! So I am definitely voting for Twu.

We get to vote for up to 8.  I don't know most of the others running (or have mild negative opinions about a few). Paola Laverde is running on [a slate with Twu](https://peoplepoweredprogressives.com/ad15.html) so that's reasonably compelling.  I learned about Nick Pilch (an Albany city council member who started an Albany pedestrian and bike advocacy group) while researching his county supervisor campaign (see below) and I dunno, if he seems reasonable enough to vote for in that race, why not this one too?


## US Representative, District 13: BARBARA LEE

Still great. Though it is disappointing that she is no longer the most
progressive member of Congress. I'd love to see her voting with "the squad" more
often!


## State Senate, District 9: NANCY SKINNER

I like her, but she's running unopposed anyway.


## State Assembly, District 15: Sara Brink??? (primary-specific decision)

Details TBA, but the tl;dr is that I'd rather keep the Republican off the
November ballot.


## Superior Court Judge, Office 2: Elena Condes???

Details TBA. Fickes seems fine too.


## Alameda County Supervisor, D5 | Nick Pilch???

Details TBA. The incumbent seems fine too.


## CA Prop 13 (school construction bonds): Yes

(Note: this is not the same as the awful Prop 13 of 1978, which we are hopefully
partially overturning in November!)

Details TBA.

## Alameda County C (sales tax for kids healthcare and preschool):  **YES!**

Details TBA.

## Berkeley E (teacher property tax), G (school construction bonds), and H (school maintenance property tax): **YES!**

Details TBA.
