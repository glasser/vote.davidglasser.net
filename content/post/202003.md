This is a relatively short post. The most controversial election on my ballot is the Presidential primary, and I'm pretty sure most of my friends have plenty of information about that already. All five propositions are "give money to kids?" and seem like easy yeses. There are only a few other contested positions, and most of them are incumbents vs relatively unknown challengers.

County committee and judge seem to be the most interesting offices on this ballot. I haven't had time to research them in full yet (I received my voter guide after early voting started!) or write up my full thoughts, but friends have already been asking my opinions, so here's my current thoughts. I hope to flesh this out further next week.

Here are my current recommendations in ballot order.

what|my vote
--:|:-----
President | Bernie Sanders (or maybe Elizabeth Warren)
County Committee, D15 | Alfred Twu, 7 others TBA
US Representative, D13 | BARBARA LEE
State Senate, D9 | NANCY SKINNER
State Assembly, D15 | Sara Brink??? (primary-specific decision)
Superior Court Judge, Office 2 | ???
Alameda County Supervisor, D5 | Nick Pilch???
13 (school construction bonds) | Yes
Alameda County C (sales tax for kids healthcare and preschool) | **YES!**
Berkeley E (teacher property tax) | **YES!**
Berkeley G (school construction bonds) | **YES!**
Berkeley H (school maintenance property tax) | **YES!**

A quick note on how these elections work. Of the three candidates for Assembly, two will end up on the ballot in the fall. On the other hand, in the Supervisor and Judge races, if any candidate gets 50%, they will win outright, so there will no November election. The County Committee race (where 8 will win) takes place entire on this ballot.

In practice, this means that the Assembly race is essentially a race between Brink (independent) and Solnordal (Republican) to see who will challenge Wicks (Democrat) in November, whereas the Supervisor race will end in March, and the Judge race may as well.
