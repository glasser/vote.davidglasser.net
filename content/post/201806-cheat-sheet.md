Here are my current recommendations in ballot order.

For more details, read my full posts on [propositions]({{< relref
"201806-props.md" >}}) and on [candidates]({{< relref "201806-candidates.md"
>}}).

On the whole, I've found fewer candidates to be excited about than in past
years, and lots of races where I'm finding it hard to come to a decision. I'd
love to hear feedback from friends in the next week before the election!
