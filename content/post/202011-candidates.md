Here are my current thoughts on candidates on the November 2020 ballot in
Berkeley, in ballot order. (I have not yet fully researched the candidates for
this election.)

a [cheat sheet]({{< relref "202011-cheat-sheet.md" >}}) summary.


## President and Vice President: JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS

Only one ticket with a chance at winning is not primarily motivated by
malevolence, spite, and bigotry. I sure didn't vote for either of these
candidates in March, but I'm sure voting for them now.


## US Representative, D13: BARBARA LEE

Still great. Though y'know, she could join "the Squad" on a few issues. But
still great.


## State Assembly, D15: Buffy Wicks

While I voted for Jovanka Beckles in both 2018 elections, I never bought into
the caricature of Buffy Wicks put forward by Beckles' supporters. While I would
have preferred to elect somebody with a deeper connection to the district and
with a more diverse campaign, I think Wicks has been a pretty good
representative and [got some good laws
passed](https://twitter.com/BuffyWicks/status/1300614466128633856).

While I like the other "candidate", Sara Brink, and voted for her in the primary
(Republicans have no business being on my ballot), she is not really running for
this office. Her [campaign website](https://www.sarabrinkforad15.com/) literally
starts with "this race does not matter". I agree with most of what she says on
her campaign site and hope this is not the last time I hear from her, but I'll
probably vote for the actual candidate in this election.


## Superior Court Judge, Office 2: Elena Condes?

I haven't done further research into this office since the primary.

Both of the candidates appear to be basically fine.  Condes has way more
endorsements than Fickes, but Fickes has a handful.  They are both LGBT and seem
to have split the LGBT org endorsements. Fickes has a pretty varied career;
Condes has focused primary on defense. In general I think our courts should have
more judges with a background in defense, so combining that with the
endorsements, I'm voting for Condes. But I'm not voting against anyone here!


## Berkeley School Directors: (choose 2)?

Needs research. (Candidates are Laura Babitt, Jos√© Luis Bedolla, Mike Chang,
Norma Harrison, Esfandiar Imani, Ana Vasudeo.)

## Berkeley Rent Board: (choose 5)?

Needs research. (Candidates are Bahman Ahmadi, Xavier Johnson, Andy Kelley,
Carole Marasovic, Dan McDunn, Mari Mendonca, Pawel Moldenhawer, Wendy Saenz Hood
Neufeld, Soulmaz Panahi, Leah Simon-Weisberg, Dominique Walker, Bianca Zahrai.)
