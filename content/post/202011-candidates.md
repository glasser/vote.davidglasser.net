Here are my current thoughts on candidates on the November 2020 ballot in
Berkeley, in ballot order.

You can also read my thoughts
on [propositions]({{< relref "202011-props.md" >}}), or see
a [cheat sheet]({{< relref "202011-cheat-sheet.md" >}}) summary.


## President and Vice President: JOE BIDEN AND KAMALA HARRIS

Only one ticket with a chance at winning is not primarily motivated by
malevolence, spite, and bigotry. I sure didn't vote for either of these
candidates in March, but I'm sure voting for them now.


## US Representative, District 13: BARBARA LEE

Still great. Though y'know, she could join "the Squad" on a few issues. But
still great.


## State Senate, District 9: NANCY SKINNER

She's a good Senator, and I don't vote for Libertarians.


## State Assembly, District 15: Buffy Wicks

While I voted for Jovanka Beckles in both 2018 elections, I never bought into
the caricature of Buffy Wicks put forward by Beckles' supporters. While I would
have preferred to elect somebody with a deeper connection to the district and
with a more diverse campaign, I think Wicks has been a pretty good
representative and [got some good laws
passed](https://twitter.com/BuffyWicks/status/1300614466128633856) (or at least
almost passed: some of these failed due to weird last minute shenanigans where
they passed both houses but didn't get reconciled).

While I like the other "candidate", Sara Brink, and voted for her in the primary
(Republicans have no business being on my ballot), she is not really running for
this office. Her [campaign website](https://www.sarabrinkforad15.com/) literally
starts with "this race does not matter". I agree with most of what she says on
her campaign site and hope this is not the last time I hear from her, but I'll
probably vote for the actual candidate in this election.


## Superior Court Judge, Office 2: Elena Condes?

I haven't done further research into this office since the primary.

Both of the candidates appear to be basically fine.  Condes has way more
endorsements than Fickes, but Fickes has a handful.  They are both LGBT and seem
to have split the LGBT org endorsements. Fickes has a pretty varied career;
Condes has focused primary on defense. In general I think our courts should have
more judges with a background in defense, so combining that with the
endorsements, I'm voting for Condes. But I'm not voting against anyone here!


## Berkeley Rent Board (choose 5): Xavier Johnson, Andy Kelley, Mari Mendonca, Leah Simon-Weisberg, and Dominique Walker?

I've only done a small amount of research so far, but I usually end up voting
for something close to the tenant slate, which this year is Xavier Johnson, Andy
Kelley, Mari Mendonca, Leah Simon-Weisberg, and Dominique Walker. (All but
Mendonca fall into that "if the East Bay DSA and East Bay For Everyone agree,
how wrong can it be?" category.)

## Berkeley School Directors (choose 2): Laura Babbit and Ana Vasudeo?

I've only done a small amount of research so far; currently leaning towards
Laura Babbitt and Ana Vasudeo based on their overall approach and endorsements.

## AC Transit Director (at-large): Victoria Fierce?

AC Transit runs the bus systems in Alameda and Contra Costa counties. (There are
only three major transit systems in America with elected directors, and we I two
of them on this very ballot: BART and AC Transit! Denver's RTD is the third.)
This election features an at-large seat that everyone in both counties votes on,
as well as elections for Ward 1 (where I live) and Ward 2 (which starts a few
blocks from my house).

I'm a bit torn on the at-large election.

On the one hand, there's the incumbent, who's been an AC Transit director for 23
years. He is not as far as I can tell actually running a campaign (maybe he has
a candidate statement in the guide which I haven't received yet, but certainly
no website or virtual events or anything). What little I can find about him is
mostly positive, including past year endorsements.

On the other hand, there's [Victoria Fierce](https://fierce.vote/). She's
somebody I've followed on Twitter for a while and have generally been impressed
with as an activist. She fits in that socialism-and-building-housing niche that
I find attractive. She has a [concrete platform](https://fierce.vote/platform/)
with basic goals like more bush shelters, a daily fare cap, and better
communication around service changes (something AC Transit really screwed up
with a recent Covid-infection-caused major service reduction with minimal
communication).

(Dollene Jones is also on the ballot; she is on the ballot for AC Transit
director in every election without running a real campaign.)

Realistically speaking I think this is a very long shot for her, running against
an incumbent in a low profile race in a very large district (all of Alameda and
Contra Costa counties). Honestly I wish that Chris Peeples respected the fact
that there's somebody on the ballot running an honest-to-God campaign with
website, (virtual) events, etc, and put together at least a tiny scrap of a
campaign website himself. Frankly I suspect if I was able to fully understand
his record and positions, I'd be impressed and vote for him. Absent that, I'm
probably going to vote for Fierce, even if I suspect that Peeples may be very
good at his job.


## AC Transit Director, Ward 1: **JOVANKA BECKLES!**

[Ward 1](http://www.actransit.org/wp-content/uploads/Ward1Final.pdf) covers most
of Berkeley, Albana, El Cerrito, Richmond, and El Sobrante. The incumbent is Joe
Wallace of Richmond. Unlike Peeples he at least has a [rudimentary campaign
site](https://joewallaceforactransit.com/), though the endorsements page is
quite bare. I really don't know anything more about him than what he's written
there. He is being challenged by Jovanka Beckles and Ben Fong.

Jovanka Beckles is a former Richmond City Councilmember, who came in second in a
crowded field in my State Assembly race last year. She's a self-identified
democratic socialist who's running on a platform of supporting the drivers'
union (in fact, she says they tapped her to run), fare-free transit (which AC
Transit has actually had for most of the year due to Covid; fares only fund a
small share of the budget), and a general Black Lives Matter/Green New Deal
approach to the system.

I wrote about her a lot two years ago in the Assembly [primary]({{< relref
"201806-candidates.md" >}}) and [general election]({{< relref
"201811-candidates.md" >}}). Both times, I said things like "If it weren't for
the issue of housing, there's little question I'd vote for Jovanka
Beckles". And: (a) this is not a particularly housing-focused role; (b) my views
on housing have evolved a little bit towards her side in the last two years
anyway; and (c) I voted for her both times even with that caveat!

So indeed, there's little question I'm voting for Jovanka Beckles this time. I
think she has the right values for this position, looking out for riders and for
the drivers who are shouldering the burden of keeping the buses safely running
in a time of pandemic.

Ben Fong seems fine, if you're looking for more of a Berkeley YIMBY type than a
Richmond DSA type. That said, even if I liked Fong and Beckles equally, any low
profile race against an incumbent is a long shot; I'm more optimistic about the
candidate who got 90 thousand votes two years ago than the one I hadn't heard of
before this race.


## AC Transit Director, Ward 2 (not my district): **JEAN WALSH!**

Bonus endorsement!

I live a few blocks from the [Ward 2
border](http://www.actransit.org/wp-content/uploads/Ward2Final.pdf); this
district covers Oakland west of about 35th Avenue plus Emeryville, Piedmont, and
a chunk of southeast Berkeley.

Like in the at-large race, the incumbent (Greg Harper) doesn't seem to have a
website or any other campaign. For some reason, he isn't even writing that he's
the incumbent on the ballot, which makes it more believable that his first-time
challenger has a chance.

That challenger is [Jean Walsh](https://www.walshforactransit.com/), who happens
to be a friend of mine! We've been on a few bike rides together over the past
few years, and I'm excited that she's running for this position, though I'm sad
I don't get to vote for her. She's focused on getting a transbay bus lane and
(like Fierce) improving communication. I wish I could vote for her!


## BART Director, D7: **LATEEFAH SIMON!**

Lateefah Simon has been an excellent BART supervisor. ([District
7](https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/bart_7.pdf) is a strange
district that contains a huge chunk of the East Bay from West Oakland out to the
Carquinez Bridge, and also a bunch of SF from the Bayview through eastern SOMA;
SF has enough population for 2.5 districts so the map gets drawn this way.)

Sharon Kidd is running against her. Her entire campaign is about being opposed
to any constraints on BART cops. No thanks.

## BART Director, D1 (not my district): JAMIE SALCIDO

Bonus endorsement!

[BART District 1](https://www.bart.gov/sites/default/files/docs/bart_1.pdf)
contains a big chunk of Contra Costa County, including Walnut Creek, Martinez,
San Ramon, and parts of Lafayette and Concord. Its incumbent, Republican Debora
Allen, is my least favorite elected official in the Bay Area. Any time I've read
about any disagreement among the BART board, Debora Allen is there spouting
something racist and/or classist. As far as I can tell, her belief is that BART
should exist solely to transport rich folks between her suburbs and downtown SF
during rush hour, and anybody else using BART is a problem. She's never seen a
BART cop action she doesn't like (even speaking out claiming it was "humiliating
to our police force" when BART apologized for violently arresting a black
passenger for eating a sandwich on the platform).

[Jamie Salcido](https://jamieforbart.com/) appears to be a competent person
running a real campaign for this seat. If you live in the district, please vote
for Salcido to get Republican Debora Allen as far away from elected office as
possible.


## East Bay Regional Park District Director, Ward 1: ?

Elizabeth Echols was appointed to this seat in January when the previous
director retired due to illness. So she is only technically running for
"re-election".

Just from reading the two candidates' [campaign](https://elizabeth4parks.org/)
[sites](http://laforceofcourse.org/), Norman La Force seemed like the clear best
candidate. Echols is a former Obama administration official whose career is
interesting but not particularly focused on East Bay parks. Her endorsements
come from a lot of people I respect but on the whole leans a little bit towards
the "moderate" (for this area) side. La Force has a deep history of involvement
with the East Bay parks, including being one of the main people behind the
creation of McLaughlin Eastshore State Park (that wild park on the way to the
Berkeley marina). He's got the more "progressive" side of the endorsement slate,
which is where I tend to lean especially on issues that aren't directly
housing-related. (Though... one of the big issues here is the development of
Point Molate for housing, which he opposes. I don't know where I fall on that
project --- it's certainly not a very transit-accessible place to focus new
development.)

Then I did more research on La Force. [This blog
post](https://milliontrees.me/2020/09/29/on-november-3rd-vote-for-a-friend-of-the-east-bay-parks/)
is a long anti-La Force polemic. For the most part I'm taking it with a grain of
salt. It seems to mostly be a guy who has strong feelings against the removal
non-native trees like eucalyptus; I'm not an expert on these issues but mostly
am anti-eucalyptus. That said, some of the things La Force has done that are
brought up in this post do trouble me. La Force's SPRAWLDEF group sued to block
the creation of the new Bay Trail segment behind Golden Gate Field (which I
love), according to [this Berkeleyside
op-ed](https://www.berkeleyside.com/2013/02/04/unexpected-opposition-from-environmentalists-to-bay-trail)... although... maybe
the op-ed is being disingenuous? Because the [actual filing it links
to](http://www.well.com/user/pk/CDAWGS/Documents/SPRAWLDEF-filing.pdf) doesn't
talk about the path at all. Maybe the path was just going to be collateral
damage? Also, apparently when he boasts about doubling the size of the Point
Isabel dog park, he's hiding that he tried to stop it from being an off-leash
dog park at all. I'm not really a dog person but I know that Point Isabel is a
wildly popular off-leash dog park, and I do think there's a place for off-leash
dog parks even though I'd prefer that not all parks work that way.  The people
who don't like La Force characterize him as being opposed to people using parks.

I am pretty torn at this point. Based on endorsements and overall character, I
lean towards La Force, but his opinions about specific parks that I know are
opposed to mine. Leaning towards voting for Echols or abstaining. Would love
advice from anyone who knows more about either of these candidates!


## Berkeley Mayor: ?

I have not been super impressed by Jesse Arreguin's tenure as mayor. He hasn't
been awful, but he hasn't been that great too. On the basis of issues and
policies alone, I'm pretty impressed by the one challenger who seems like he
might stand even a small chance of winning, [Wayne
Hsiung](https://www.wayneformayor.com/). I found Hsiung to be pretty compelling
when he knocked on our door and we talked for a bit.

Hsiung is best known as the founder of the vegan activist group [Direct Action
Everywhere](https://www.directactioneverywhere.com/), something he does not
highlight as part of his campaign. I don't have strong opinions in either
direction about this work itself. But I am definitely concerned by accusations
that [DxE is an abusive cult](https://dismantledxe.wordpress.com/), and about
[sketchy behavior toward a 16 year old when he was
27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q3zUZzBWMS0) (and Hsiung [does not deny
sending her these
emails](https://www.directactioneverywhere.com/theliberationist/2020-5-8-saul-elbein-business-insider-and-the-corruption-of-modern-journalism)). Maybe
this is a conspiracy by the meat industry to make him look bad, but it's
concerning enough that I don't think I'm comfortable voting for him despite
liking his platform.

I may abstain.

## Berkeley City Council, D3: Ben Bartlett #1, Deborah Matthews #2?

The two major candidates were also the two major candidates [four years ago]({{<
relref "201611-candidates.md" >}}). I wasn't ultra impressed by either of them
four years ago (I did vote for Matthews), and that hasn't changed.

I'm still underwhelmed by the idea of voting for Matthews, a literal realtor,
for a housing-centric position (especially as my confidence in my YIMBY-ish
tendencies has waned).

I still feel like Bartlett mostly just says what people want to hear. He keeps
telling me he's made a deal to get something to happen to the abandoned houses
across the street any day now. It's hard to forget the story I mentioned 4 years
ago about him whispering in my ear that he actually supported the project he was
speaking against that night (though hey, no lie, he did end up pushing to get
the project through once elected, though the project seems to have fallen
through after that anyway). As soon as he was elected to his first office he
immediately began running for Assembly (and came in 8th in the primary). He
tried to get out of a red light ticket by texting the chief of police. He's got
a weird blockchain obsession, though I don't think he's actually figured out a
way to try to get the city to use it.

That said, I do usually agree with his actual City Council votes. Recently, I'm
happy that he's a cosponsor of Rigel Robinson's proposal to break all traffic
enforcement out of the Police Department into a new Department of
Transportation. While many other countries work this way, it's virtually unknown
in the US, and is the sort of bold move Berkeley should be doing. (I emailed
Matthews and she is vaguely positive on this policy but it doesn't seem like
it's a priority, though she has other ideas about policing that are
interesting.)

I am very slightly leaning towards Bartlett at this point, but not particularly
excited about either major candidate. That said, I'm not going to abstain
because I definitely want to make sure that there's no chance that the third
candidate, Orlando Martinez, gets elected. He's part of the usual gang of
anti-taxers who write the opposition statement on every otherwise
non-controversial revenue-raising Berkeley proposition. While I doubt he has any
chance of winning, expressing my disapproval of his brand of politics is
important, so I will definitely be voting for Bartlett and Matthews in some
order in this ranked-choice election.
