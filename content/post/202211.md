Another November, another election. I'm still in the process of researching my Berkeley ballot and haven't made up my mind on some of the trickier races and propositions. But I've got a fair amount to say already. (And while I'm working on it, definitely **vote Pamela Price for Alameda County DA and Alfred Twu for AC Transit director**.)

## Democrats running against Republicans

- Governor: Gavin Newsom
- Lieutenant Governor: Eleni Kounalakis
- Secretary of State: Shirley Weber!
- Controller: Malia Cohen
- Treasurer: Fiona Ma
- Attorney General: Rob Bonta!
- Insurance Commissioner: Ricardo Lara
- Board of Equaliation, 2nd District: Sally Lieber!
- Senator (full term): ALEX PADILLA
- Senator (partial term): ALEX PADILLA
- US Representative, District 12: BARBARA LEE
- State Assembly, District 14: Buffy Wicks

These are all Democrats running in two-candidate races against Republicans. If you were considering voting for a Republican in 2022, then I'm not sure why you're reading my voter guide. Some of these are folks I voted for in the primary; some aren't. But they're all better than the Republican running against them! Don't forget to vote for Padilla twice.


## Supreme Court and Court of Appeals Judges: Yes to all?

I haven't done significant research here other than reading [brief descriptions of each judge](https://www.theleaguesf.org/#judgesSC) by the SF League of Pissed-off Voters. They recommend voting yes on all of them. (They do praise Gordon Burns for ruling in favor of Berkeley neighbors' lawsuit against UC Berkeley in 2020, which I find to be a hypocritical lawsuit that complains about the impact on housing while simultaneously working to block student housing; but that was a 3-0 ruling.) A few names ring a bell, like Therese Stewart who was a major part of San Francisco's legal battle for marriage equality. Following the League's suggestions and voting yes unless I learn more.

## State Superintendent of Public Instruction: TONY THURMOND

This one doesn't say "Democrat vs Republican" on the ballot, but it is. Thurmond has apparently not been as great as hoped for in office. But Christensen is a Christian supremacist who wants to bring staff-led prayer to public schools. Vote Thurmond!

## District Attorney: PAMELA PRICE

Pamela Price (who I voted for [four years ago]({{< relref "201806-candidates.md" >}}) for the same position as well as in this year's primary, and who came in third for Oakland Mayor in 2018) is a civil rights attorney looking to move the DA's office in a progressive direction. Frankly it's been challenging to get a great read on Terry Wiley, who wasn't the most "don't worry cops, I'll let you run wild" of the candidates in the primary; I don't think he will be a disaster for the county. But I'm excited to vote for Pamela Price.

## Berkeley Rent Board: ?

Still researching. I do usually end up voting for the tenant slate.

## Berkeley School Directors: ?

Still researching. I am frankly finding this race a bit challenging. On the one hand, there seem to be very strong emotions from people who care about the race. On the other hand, it's challenging to actually understand the differences between most of the candidates (and most of them seem to be endorsed by everyone). Would love to hear thoughts from folks who are well-informed.

## AC Transit Director (at-large): ALFRED TWU!

I've been impressed by Alfred Twu for years. Twu cares deeply about transit and creating a world where buses work. I've also really enjoyed Twu's ability to make complex issues in local planning understandable and beautiful via [urban art](https://www.ocf.berkeley.edu/~atwu/alfred/index.html) and graphic design.

Twu's opponent is the incumbent, Joel Young. I don't know much about Young, but what I do know is largely negative. He's been credibly accused of domestic violence and was censured by the AC Transit Board for using district property for personal gain. Whenever the board has a split vote, I've generally seen him on the wrong side.

Twu has earned an excellent set of endorsements, including my two favorite AC Transit Directors (my own district's Director Jovanka Beckles and my friend Jean Walsh). As a frequent AC Transit rider, I'd love to see Alfred Twu in charge.

## 1 (constitutional right to abortion and birth control): YES!!!

Will enshrining the right to abortion and birth control (plus the right to refuse birth control) into the California Constitution actually help protect us against a federal abortion ban? I don't know, but it certainly won't hurt. With forced birth now the law in half of our country, anything we can do to defend these fundamental rights is worth trying.

## 26 (sports betting at tribal casinos and racetracks): ?

Need to think more about this one.

## 27 (online sports betting): No

Need to write more details here, but voting no.

## 28 (funding for arts in public schools): YES

We are fortunate that our public school has a thriving arts program, though it is highly supplemented by by PTA donations. Every kid in public school in California should have that opportunity. While ballot-box budgeting is not my favorite approach, underfunded schools can make good use of dedicated arts funding. Excited to vote yes.

## 29 (dialysis clinic changes, again): No?

I ended up [voting no on a very similar proposition in 2020]({{< relref "202011-props.md" >}}), despite a lot of sympathy for the union behind these measures. I'm not sure yet about this year, but by default will probably vote no again.

## 30 (tax ultra-rich to fund electric cars): Yes?

A tricky one requiring more thought. Taxing folks making over $2 million is fine and dandy. Are electric vehicles the the best use for that revenue? Especially since a lot of this will be used to save Lyft (the proposition's main supporter) a lot of money that they'll need to hit their environmental requirements? I don't know. But I suspect if this one fails, it'll be harder to get the next ultra-rich tax on the ballot. And while better cars alone won't save us from climate change, EVs are at least an important part of the solution. So probably yes?

## 31 (keep law banning flavored tobacco): Yes

This is one of those "veto referenda": a special proposition that takes a law passed by the legislature and asks us to vote on it instead. Unless I have particular knowledge and passion about the law in question, my default is generally to support representative document by allowing the legislature's law to go into effect by voting "yes".

I'm not a big fan of prohibition, but generally consider the addictiveness and health impacts of tobacco to be well worth regulating. I'm not an expert on flavored tobacco specifically, and were this a normal proposition I might vote no on the basis of "eh, this seems like the sort of thing the legislature should deal with". But in this case, that's what "yes" means!


## Alameda County D (more buildings on agricultural land): Yes?

Apparently, in 2000 Alameda County passed a proposition requiring lots of land in eastern Alameda County to remain undeveloped (to be used as agricultural and park land). This is an update to that proposition which allows a bit more development on that land, specifically for agricultural and equestrian buildings. It was placed on the ballot by the County Supervisors. My Supervisor (Keith Carson) did vote earlier this summer and abstained from the final vote, but that seems to have been primarily due to wanting input from the Sierra Club (major proponents of the 2000 proposition), who appear to have not taken a position on this proposition. The Supervisors representing the relevant part of the county support this, and in general I think it's reasonable for elected government to make small changes like this. "Yes" seems reasonable.

## Berkeley L (housing and infrastructure bonds): Yes?

This is a relatively large bond for not-yet-specified affordable housing and infrastructure programs, placed on the ballot by a unanimous vote of City Council. There does seem to be a *bit* more objection to it than your typical "I hate all taxes so I hate this tax", but I am tentatively in favor while I do more research.

## Berkeley M (vacancy tax): Yes

This levies a tax on residential units that are vacant for six months or more, with various exceptions including for units in the process of a permitted repair and units in properties of four or fewer units where one is owner-occupied. I'm not actually clear on how much of Berkeley's housing crisis is caused by properties left intentionally vacant in lieu of lowering rental rates, but this seems like a reasonable approach toward that problem if it really is one.

## Berkeley N (allow more affordable housing): Yes

Six years ago I said the following about Prop Z1: This is a relatively technical ballot measure that's required by yet another stupid clause in the CA constitution to raise a cap on the amount of affordable housing the City can work on.  It doesn't commit any funds.  No real downside or argument against.

Well, we have to do it again for the same reason. I'm happy to see that we're raising the cap by a larger amount this time, so that we won't need another one of these propositions for a longer time. This time there is an argument against it, but it's completely ridiculous: it claims that the 3000 units will cost us too much, but this proposition doesn't *require* the city build 3000 units of affordable housing; it merely *allows* it by lifting a cap that shouldn't exist in the first place.

## Berkeley Auditor: Jenny Wong

I guess they put the ranked-choice races at the back. Anyway, I've only heard good things about Wong, and she's unopposed.
