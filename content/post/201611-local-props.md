Here are my current thoughts on the Berkeley, Alameda County, AC Transit, and
BART propositions on the November 2016 ballot.

You can also
read
[my thoughts on statewide propositions]({{< relref "201611-ca-props.md" >}}). I'll
write up my thoughts on candidates soon.


## AC Transit (Alameda and Contra Costa counties)

### YES ON C1

This renews the current AC Transit flat property tax for 20 more years. If this
fails, buses will lose a major source of funding.  Please vote yes: like many
other taxes, it needs 2/3 support.

## BART (Alameda, Contra Costa, and SF counties)

### YES ON RR

After 44 years, BART is aging.  It needs major infrastructure work to just keep
working at its current capacity, let alone keep up with the population growth
and move away from car-reliance in the region. This bond is necessary to keep it
from falling apart. My life (and choice of house purchase) is made possible by
BART. I am pretty scared that this (2/3-required) bond will fail.

Honestly, the arguments against depress me. Most of them are people who are
upset that BART employees are moderately well paid.  Frankly --- BART enables
the economy of the Bay Area to work, and certainly enables my entire current
lifestyle. I am proud that the employees who make the system work are paid
well. They deserve it.

## Alameda County
### Yes on A1

County affordable housing bond. Seems reasonable enough; haven't heard much
about it but haven't heard any reason why not to vote yes. There is no official
argument against.

## Berkeley Unified School District
### YES ON E1

This renews (sort of) a property tax that provides 20% of school district
funding.  (I say "sort of" because it is adjusted for inflation, and also
responds to a recent court ruling preventing school districts from taxing
residential and commercial properties differently by raising the rate on
residential and reducing on commercial, which is a shame but necessary.)
Without this, BUSD loses a huge amount of funding. Please vote YES ON E1.

## City of Berkeley

### YES ON T1

Infrastructure bond. Unanimously supported by City Council; no arguments
against.

### Yes on U1, no on DD

U1 is a rental tax that is unanimously supported by City Council. It's opposed
by big landlords, who put DD on the ballot instead, and confusingly claim that
U1 is the one that's good for big landlords. U1 is a higher tax rate than DD.
U1 exempts landlords with fewer than 5 units *and all units in their first 12
years after construction*.  The big landlords are focusing on that exemption.
It seems like a reasonable way to encourage construction to me, and the
landlords are being disingenuous by conflating "owners of lots of property" with
"owners of new constructions".  Everything I read other than the propaganda in
my mailbox says yes on U1, no on DD.

### YES ON V1

Because the California constitution has been mangled by greedy anti-tax
anti-civilization assholes, every city needs to pass this ballot measure every 4
years in order to actually use tax money that has already been voted on. All it
does is say "Those taxes you're paying?  We're allowed to spend that money even
though it's more than our budget was in 1986".  If this fails, we'll still be
paying the same taxes but the city will be forced to sit on part of the money
for no good reason.

### Yes on W1?

This would change City Council redistricting to be done by an independent
redistricting committee instead of the council itself, kind of like has been
done at the state level. The jury's still out for me as to whether it was a good
idea at the state level, but this seems reasonable to me. Specifically, the old
method apparently always led to conflict, as council members ensured their home
stayed in their district. This seems reasonable enough, and there's no argument
against it.

### YES ON X1

This seems like a well-designed public financing system for Mayor and City
Council elections. There are already strict limits on campaign donations in
Berkeley, but this would say that if you limit yourself to $50 per donor (and
meet a minimum), you can get public funding of 6 times the amount you got from
Berkeley residents, up to a limit. The claim is that this would not severely
affect the budget.  This septupling makes it seem pretty likely that many
candidates would actually use it. Sounds good to me.

### YES ON Y1

Allow people age 16 and 17 to vote on the school board. Yes, allowing people to
vote (on the most relevant topic!) young will help people get in the habit of
voting.

### YES ON Z1

This is a relatively technical ballot measure that's required by yet another
stupid clause in the CA constitution to raise a cap on the amount of affordable
housing the City can work on.  It doesn't commit any funds.  No real downside or
argument against.

### YES ON AA

This limits the ability of owner-move-in evictions to force families with
school-age kids to move in the middle of the year and requires landlords to pay
a $15,000 relocation fee.  As a homeowner who considered buying houses with
tenants (or moving into a unit owned by my mother-in-law) and a friend of people
who have done owner-move-in, I do think that owner-move-in is a reasonable thing
for people buying homes they want to personally live in (or close family
members) to do. But I don't think it needs to be cheap.  $15K does sound like a
lot, and I personally don't have that amount sitting around in my bank account
today. But if you're buying a house and planning to move in immediately, you can
work this amount into your decision-making strategy. And if you've owned the
house for a long time, then you likely can get a home equity loan for that
amount (something your tenants have no access to).

The school kids clause seems pretty unequivocably good to me as well.

There are no arguments submitted against this proposition.

### NO ON BB, NO ON CC

Oh Berkeley. So two dueling versions of a $15 minimum wage increase got on the
ballot. Then like a day after it was too late to change the ballot, the two
sides came to a compromise and passed a compromise version directly into law.
Both proponents now say to vote no on both.  If you say so!
