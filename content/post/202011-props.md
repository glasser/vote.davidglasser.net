Here are my current thoughts on the propositions on the November 2020 ballot. (I
have not yet fully researched the propositions for this election.)

You can also read my thoughts
on [candidates]({{< relref "202011-candidates.md" >}}), or see
a [cheat sheet]({{< relref "202011-cheat-sheet.md" >}}) summary.


## State-wide propositions

### ? on 14 (stem cell research bonds)

Needs research.


### **YES!!!** on 15 (fix prop 13 for commercial property)

writeup tk


### Yes? on 16 (un-ban affirmative action)

Needs research but seems like the sort of thing I like.


### Yes? on 17 (voting rights for parolees)

Needs research but seems like the sort of thing I like.


### Yes? on 18 (17-year-olds voting in primaries)

Needs research but seems like the sort of thing I like.


### No? on 19 (make prop 13 worse)

Pretty sure this is a retread of the terrible [Prop 5 from 2018]({{< relref
"201811-props.md" >}}). Full writeup tk

### No? on 20 (more felonies, less parole)

Needs research but seems like the sort of thing I dislike.


### Yes? on 21 (allow more rent control)

Needs research but seems like the sort of thing I like.


### **NO!!!** on 22 (let uber mis-classify employees)

writeup tk

### ? on 23 (dialysis clinic changes)

Needs research.


### No? on 24 (privacy law changes)

Needs research but seems inappropriate for the ballot box.


### Yes? on 25 (keep law ending cash bail)

Needs research but seems like the sort of thing I like.


## Other local propositions?

I don't know if there are any local propositions other than Berkeley propositions.

## Berkeley propositions

### ? on FF (fire/emergency tax)

Needs research but seems like the sort of thing I like.


### ? on GG (uber tax)

Needs research but seems like the sort of thing I like.


### ? on HH (utility tax)

Needs research but seems like the sort of thing I like.


### ? on II (police accountability)

Needs research.


### ? on JJ (mayor and council pay)

Needs research but seems like the sort of thing I like.


### ? on KK (update city charter)

Needs research but seems like the sort of thing I like.


### YES on LL (let us spend our budget)

Because the California constitution has been mangled by greedy anti-tax
anti-civilization assholes, every city needs to pass this ballot measure every 4
years in order to actually use tax money that has already been voted on. All it
does is say "Those taxes you're paying?  We're allowed to spend that money even
though it's more than our budget was in 1986".  If this fails, we'll still be
paying the same taxes but the city will be forced to sit on part of the money
for no good reason. (This answer copied from [2016's V1]({{< relref
"201611-local-props.md" >}}) and I assume I'll write it again in 2024, assuming
we still have a democracy then.)

(The only positive thing about this proposition is that I see Orlando Martinez
is one of the few people who think we should vote against it, which means I
don't even have to bother to research his City Council candidacy.)

### ? on MM (more rent control)

Needs research but seems like the sort of thing I like.
