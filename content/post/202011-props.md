Here are my current thoughts on the propositions on the November 2020 ballot. (I
have not yet fully researched the propositions for this election.)

## State-wide propositions

### ? on 14 (stem cell research bonds)

Not sure on this one.

In 2004, Prop 71 used a bond to raise $3 billion for stem cell research grants. This money has run out, and this proposition essentially renews it by raising another $5.5 billion for stem cell research.

On the one hand, I'm generally a sucker for "raise taxes or sell bonds to fund something decent", and stem cell research is something decent. But I'm more motivated to do so when the proposition comes from our elected government as opposed to a separate organization. I'm not sure how to evaluate the claim that this is less necessary these days since Obama relaxed federal constraints on funding stem cell research.

I'd like to learn more. If I had to choose today, I'd vote yes I guess.


### **YES!!!** on 15 (fix prop 13 for commercial property)

In 1978, Prop 13 devastated the budgets of all local governments in California by (among other things) capping property taxes at 1% and basing property taxes to their assessed value at the time of purchase (with adjustment for inflation) rather than a current assessed price. (It also requires lots of taxes to be voted on as propositions (that's why these ballots are so long) and requires a supermajority in the legislature to pass state taxes.)  It especially resulted in a sharp loss of funding for schools.

This year's Prop 15 is a chance to undo a tiny bit of Prop 13. Specifically, it taxes **commercial** properties (not residential!) worth over $3 million on their current property value, not their property value at purchase time. It does not affect residential property taxation, and does not change the 1% cap.  It will make corporations that have owned property for decades pay taxes at the same level as their newer competitors across the street, and will raise $6-11 billion for local governments (school districts, cities, transit districts, etc) annually.  It is, unsurprisingly, supported by most folks who you would expect to support a functional government, and opposed primarily by Republicans and organizations focused on not paying taxes. I found it a bit concerning to see the California NAACP on the no side, but a [bit of research](https://calmatters.org/politics/2020/09/california-naacp-president-helps-corporate-ballot-measure-campaigns/) shows that the California NAACP seems to take a bunch of surprising positions on ballot measures which just happen to coincide with which proposition campaigns fund their president's consulting firm.

California has long been held back by Prop 13. Let's finally start to fix it.


### Yes on 16 (un-ban affirmative action)

We have not solved racism. Until it was made illegal by Prop 209 in 1996, affirmative action allowed institutions such as the University of California to take race into account as one aspect of decision-making in pursuit of outcomes that better reflect our state's diversity. While it would be great to live in a world where affirmative action is no longer needed, we continue to live in a white supremicist society and Prop 209 has been harmful to our attempts to improve that. Prop 16 would repeal Prop 209. Sounds good to me.

This made it to the ballot from the legislature from a 75-25 vote (no Democrats voted now). The only reason we have to vote on this at all instead of letting our legislature determine policy is that the current policy is locked into the California Constitution from Prop 209.

### **YES!!!** on 17 (voting rights for parolees)

Felony disenfranchisement is one of the main methods of voter suppression in 2020.  The choice of what is consider a felony vs a misdemeanor (or even not a crime, like wage theft) is relatively arbitrary as is the choice of where to focus law enforcement. One in 13 black adults have lost their right to vote due to felony disenfranchisement laws, compared to only 1 in 56 non-black adults.

In California, we ban people currently imprisoned for a felony from voting as well as those currently on parole. Prop 17 would provide voting rights to parolees (while still disenfranchising the incarcerated).

Ideally, we should join Maine and Vermont by allowing all adults to vote and completely dropping the system of felony disenfranchisement. Voting yes on 17 will let us join such radical leftist states like [North Dakota, Indiana, and Ohio](https://www.aclu.org/issues/voting-rights/voter-restoration/felony-disenfranchisement-laws-map) in only stripping voting rights from people currently in prison. It's a step in the right direction. This proposition was placed on the ballot by 70% of the legislature.

### Yes? on 18 (17-year-olds voting in primaries)

Needs research but seems like the sort of thing I like.


### No? on 19 (make prop 13 worse)

Pretty sure this is a retread of the terrible [Prop 5 from 2018]({{< relref
"201811-props.md" >}}). Full writeup tk

### No? on 20 (more felonies, less parole)

Needs research but seems like the sort of thing I dislike.


### Yes? on 21 (allow more rent control)

Needs research but seems like the sort of thing I like.


### **NO!!!** on 22 (let uber mis-classify employees)

writeup tk

### ? on 23 (dialysis clinic changes)

Needs research.


### No? on 24 (privacy law changes)

Needs research but seems inappropriate for the ballot box.


### Yes? on 25 (keep law ending cash bail)

Needs research but seems like the sort of thing I like.


## Other local propositions?

I don't know if there are any local propositions other than Berkeley propositions. (I believe there are, but I haven't received my sample ballot yet.)

## Berkeley propositions

Berkeley helpfully has a [site with all of its proposition text and arguments](https://www.cityofberkeley.info/Ballot_Measure_Information.aspx).

### Yes on FF (fire/emergency tax)

I object to the [Prop 13 requirement that all local taxes require voter approval](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1978_California_Proposition_13#Voting_Requirements_Local_Taxes) and generally believe in supporting any tax that City Council unanimously puts on the ballot. While I certainly have my concerns about some of what City Council does, I do not believe the repetitive arguments that my city's anti-tax zealots put forth on every single tax proposition. The causes supported by this tax seem reasonable and the amount isn't high. The argument against this tax makes the highly misleading claim that this will "double" taxes; while perhaps it will double *the part of our square-footage-based taxes that pays for fire and paramedics*, that's not the same as doubling taxes overall! For my home I believe this will increase my taxes by 2%.


### Yes on GG (uber tax)

As described in FF, I generally vote for taxes that City Council unanimously supported (Davila abstained from this one but that's close enough), though I do think a little more carefully when it's not just a simple property tax. I did occasionally use Lyft before covid, but believe it's appropriate to tax Lyft and Uber to support local governments, as Chicago does and Oakland tried to. Fifty cents seems like a fine amount.


### Yes on HH (utility tax)

Third tax in a row supported by a unanimous City Council and opposed only by the same gang of anti-taxers. This one raises taxes that we pay on our gas and electric bills, which are a percentage of the bill cost (so conserving energy can help you pay less of this tax). It also exempts low-income folks in two programs that help pay utility bills from the entire tax (not just the new part!). I probably would have voted for it even without the second part, but making this tax less regressive seems like a positive change in and of itself. So yes!


### Yes on II (police accountability)

This proposition replaces the Police Review Commission with a Police Accountability Board. It was placed on the ballot by a unanimous City Council, and apparently was part of a collaboration between the City Council, the existing Police Review Commission, and the police department. At least according to the argument in favor, it expands the review powers of the organization, doing things like extending the deadline for filing complaints, requiring officers to testify, etc. It does appear that the only action it can take are "recommendations"; if the BPD disagrees with the Board's determination, the City Manager makes the final choice. There are no official arguments against this proposition and it is supported by groups like the Berkeley ACLU and NAACP. While I can't say I fully understand the details of how the new Board will be different from the old Commission, it sounds good to me.


### Yes? on JJ (mayor and council pay)

Berkeley City Council members currently receive a salary of $38K and the Mayor receives a salary of $61K. This proposition would change the formula to one that currently results in $67K for Council members and $107K for the Mayor. With the current cost of living in Berkeley, it is challenging for our elected officials to treat their office as a full time job unless their family has another source of income or they are just wealthy. I do believe that paying elected officials well can allow for a more diverse (and slightly less bribeable!) government as well as letting them focus on their office. So I am planning to vote yes on this.

I would be even more excited to vote for this if it had a delayed start date (say, taking effect in 2 years after the next local election) to make it more clear that this is thinking about the future Council composition, not just the folks who voted to put it on the ballot. But it's still generally a good idea.


### Yes on KK (update city charter)

KK seems to be a bunch of mostly technical amendments to the City Charter: gender-neutral language (yay!), changing who can be on a commission to be inclusive of non-citizens (which is also required by state law), defining what the City Attorney does more clearly, etc. Maybe the most interesting part is no longer requiring firefighters to live within 40 miles of Berkeley, which is something that I don't have strong opinions about. (I do think it's better when cops live where they work, but I'm not sure the same concerns apply to firefighters.) The City Council voted unanimously for this. Sounds fine.


### YES on LL (let us spend our budget)

Because the California constitution has been mangled by greedy anti-tax
anti-civilization assholes, every city needs to pass this ballot measure every 4
years in order to actually use tax money that has already been voted on. All it
does is say "Those taxes you're paying?  We're allowed to spend that money even
though it's more than our budget was in 1986".  If this fails, we'll still be
paying the same taxes but the city will be forced to sit on part of the money
for no good reason. (This answer copied from [2016's V1]({{< relref
"201611-local-props.md" >}}) and I assume I'll write it again in 2024, assuming
we still have a democracy then.)

(The only positive thing about this proposition is that I see Orlando Martinez
is one of the few people who think we should vote against it, which means I
don't even have to bother to research his City Council candidacy.)

### Yes on MM (more rent control)

Of the 8 Berkeley propositions, this one requires the most thought for me. (I believe it's the only one put on the ballot by a City Council vote where any Council member voted no.)  It does three different things:

- Ensures that rent payment not paid due to legally declared states of emergency (like the one we are in now) does not retroactively become cause for eviction after the state of emergency ends.
- Requires landlords whose properties are not eligible for rent control to register them with the Rent Board, including a fee (which hypothetically may only cover costs). If you're just renting out your primary residence for less than two years, you don't have to do this.
- Clarifies that the ADU (accessory dwelling unit, eg backyard cottage) exemption from rent control only covers properties with one single-family house and one ADU (which was the only legal way to create an ADU when the ADU exemption passed, but which has changed).

As somebody who generally supports rent control, these all seem basically reasonable.

An eviction moratorium does not actually help tenants if they will be evicted as soon as the moratorium ends for the same missed payments that they couldn't pay before (vs being evicted for continued missed payments post-moratorium or for other cause, which is not affected by this proposition). Of course in an ideal world, landlords would also be able to obtain similar mortgage relief, and that is the case for the current state eviction moratorium.

Getting more information about rentals in the city seems like it would be a largely positive change.

And if you have multiple ADUs, or an ADU next to an apartment building, it does seem like this "ADU" should just be treated more like an apartment rather than a special case.
