I have not yet fully researched my Berkeley ballot for this election. While there are many choices to make, there are no propositions, and most elections involve a Democratic incumbent running against no serious opposition from the left.

But there are a few really important elections!

I will update this post with full details later, but **the most important elections in Berkeley are for sheriff and district attorney**.

Our current Sheriff Greg Ahern is the one Republican currently representing me. He's pro-Trump and pro-ICE and has presided over awful conditions (especially in COVID) in our county jails.

It's challenging to replace an incumbent sheriff in California. You can legally only run if you're some kind of cop, and if you ever lose an election against the incumbent, well, your career is probably over.

So it's exciting that we have two serious challengers to Ahern in this election. As far as I can tell with my limited research so far, they would both be better than him. As long as he doesn't get 50% of the vote, there will be a general election in the fall where the top two candidates will run. So as long as you vote for somebody other than him, we're in good shape.

I think I will be voting for Yesenia Sanchez. But maybe JoAnn Walker is good too. But the most important thing is to **vote for one of the two non-Ahern candidates for sheriff**.

It's a rare District Attorney election with no incumbent as well. There are four candidates. Jimmie Wilson is running on the platform of "all the cop unions endorse me". So far I suspect Pamela Price (who I voted for [four years ago]({{< refref "201806-candidates.md" >}}) for the same position) will get my vote.  Or maybe Seth Steward.  But definitely **vote for somebody other than Jimmie Wilson for District Attorney** (probably Price).

More to come later!
